The TrainGame is a collaborative class project between Brett Holman,
Zakk Roberts, and myself.  As a concept, TrainGame is based off of a real game
that I play in a model railroading club and I had a strong personal interest in
seeing the manual aspects of it become automated.  Special emphasis was placed
on table normalization and thorough testing for this project.  

Major Deliverables:
-- A comprehensive development manual
-- A live project presentation
-- A console app demonstrating basic gameplay and database interactions
-- Entity and Relationship Model Diagrams
-- A fully featured MySQL database with custom views, functions, triggers, and
   stored procedures for common tasks.
